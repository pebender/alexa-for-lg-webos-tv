# Overview

alexa-for-lg-webos-tv enables the control of LG Electronics televisions that run webOS but do not have built-in Alexa support. There are two parts to the software: an Alexa skill and a bridge.
The Alexa skill presents one or more TVs each with controls relevant to the television the skill is controlling.
The bridge converts between the Alexa skill and LG webOS TVs.
