# Introduction

alexa-for-lg-webos-tv enables Alexa control of LG Electronics televisions that run webOS but don't have built-in Alexa support. There are two parts to the software: an Alexa skill and a bridge. The Alexa skill presents one or more TVs each with controls relevant to the television the skill is controlling. The bridge converts between the Alexa skill and LG webOS TVs.
