## Description

The Alexa for LG webOS TV software (alexa-for-lg-webos-tv) consists of two [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) packages: the skill (alexa-for-lg-webos-tv-skill) and the bridge (alexa-for-lg-webos-tv-bridge). The skill is to be run on the Amazon cloud. The bridge is to be run on the same local network as the TVs to be controlled.

The skill communicates with the bridge using [the skill to bridge interface](./skill-to-bridge-interface.md#the-skill-to-bridge-interface). [The skill](./skill.md#the-skill) is responsible for routing Smart Home Skill protocol messages between the Alexa Cloud and the bridge. [The bridge](./bridge.md#the-bridge) is responsible for translating between Smart Home Skill protocol and the LG webOS TV protocol. Both the skill and the bridge are responsible for establishing secure communication between the skill and the bridge.
